Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip such as the [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip], the [Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixel][flora], the [Adafruit Breadboard-friendly RGB Smart Pixel][pixel], the [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick][stick], and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield].

Slightly modified October 2015 by Bill Silver of Gizmo Garden for servo compatibility. 100% backwards compatible with Adafruit version 1.0.3.

You can use this library exactly as you use the Adafruit original, and it will behave exactly the same way, including the interference with servo operation. If you want servo compatability, use the GizmoGarden_Pixels library, which presents the same interface but properly works with the GizmoGarden_Servo library. You must include this library to use GizmoGarden_Pixels.
