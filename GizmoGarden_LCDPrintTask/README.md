Gizmo Garden library for using an Adafruit LCD shield with the GizmoGarden_Multitasking library. Implements a class that provides a subset of Adafruit_RGBLCDShield, internally breaking up LCD operations into small pieces so as not to bog down cooperative multitasking.

Requires Gizmogarden_Common, GizmoGarden_Multitasking, and Adafruit-RGB-LCD-Shield-Library.
