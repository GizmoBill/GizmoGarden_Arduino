The Catalog directory contains all of the Arduino sketch code used in Gizmo Garden 2016 to make self-driving parade floats, with creative options for music, NeoPixel light shows, servos, and scrolling text displays. We used version 1.6.6 of the Arduino app. 

Create a directory called Parade in the Arduino directory and copy Parade and PlayGround to it. With these two files, students can create their beep party and dance party to get some exposure to coding and to experiment with the piezo buzzer and moving and steering the gizmo.

For the basic self-driving gizmo, add copies of the files Drive, Sensors, Spring, and _SaveData. Files can be added by selecting Add File from the Sketch menu of the Arduino app.

The rest of the files in the Catalog can be added to the sketch for the various creative options. Instructions are included in each file.
